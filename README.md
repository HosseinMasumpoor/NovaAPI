# NovaAPI

**NovaAPI** is a lightweight and powerful mini-framework for building APIs in PHP.  
Inspired by modern architectures and leveraging tools like Symfony and Eloquent, it provides a solid foundation for fast API development.

## üöÄ Performance Benchmarks (Real-World Tests)

**Test Environment**:
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Hardware**: Desktop with 12-core 2.5GHz CPU, 32GB RAM
- üêß **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop
- üõ†Ô∏è **Stack**: PHP 8.4 + Apache + MySQL
- üîß **Test Tool**: `ab`

**Key Results**:
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Avg. Response Time**:
   - NovaAPI: **6ms**
   - Laravel: **60ms** (10x slower)
- üñ•Ô∏è **CPU Utilization**:
   - NovaAPI: Reaches **100% CPU at ~100 concurrent requests**
   - Laravel: Reaches **100% CPU at just ~10 concurrent requests**
- üöÄ **Max Throughput**:
   - NovaAPI: **5,000+ RPS** before significant degradation
   - Laravel: **~500 RPS** under same conditions

**Interpretation**:  
NovaAPI demonstrates:  
‚úî **Up to 10x better concurrency handling**  
‚úî **Up to 10x lower CPU usage per request**  
‚úî **More efficient resource utilization** for high-load APIs

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation

```bash
composer install
```


## Getting Started

To start the application, you should first make sure that your PHP environment is properly configured (PHP 8.x or later recommended) and your database connection settings are defined.

Unlike Laravel's built-in server, this framework is intended to be run with a web server like **Apache**, **Nginx**, or **Caddy**. Simply point your web server‚Äôs document root to the `public` directory of the project.

Basic steps to get it running:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HosseinMasumpoor/NovaAPI
    cd NovaAPI
    ```

2. Install dependencies via Composer:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. Configure your `.env` file (database, cache, etc.).

4. Configure your web server (e.g., with Apache‚Äôs `DocumentRoot` set to `public/`).

5. Visit your app‚Äôs URL in the browser and you‚Äôre ready to go!


## Configuration

All configuration files are located in the `config` directory. You can easily extend and override default settings as needed. The configuration system also supports caching to ensure high performance in production environments.

## Extending

You can extend the framework by creating new service providers, facades, middlewares, or even replacing core components. The flexible architecture allows you to register your custom components within the service container and hook them into the framework lifecycle.

## Authentication

The framework includes a flexible authentication system that supports different drivers, such as JWT and OTP. You can easily add new drivers by implementing the `GuardInterface` or extending the existing driver implementation.
